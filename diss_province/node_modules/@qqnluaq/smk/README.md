*A versatile and lightweight toolkit for building a simple web map.*

**SMK** is designed to make it easy to integrate a map into a web application.

The application needs to include one `<script>` tag to load the library, define a single `<div>` tag to contain the map, and call one method to initialize the map.
There is no other code for the application to write, the map functionality is defined completely by a JSON configuration structure.

Here is an example of a complete HTML page that uses SMK to show a map:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>SMK Demo</title>
        <script src="smk.js"></script>
        <style>
            #smk-map-frame { 
                position: absolute; 
                top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; 
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="smk-map-frame"></div>
        <script>
            SMK.INIT( { containerSel: '#smk-map-frame' } )
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

The [client API](docs/SMK-Client-API) details how the application interacts with the map.
There are [examples](docs/SMK-Client-API-Examples) of the various ways the map can be configured.
The [configuration](docs/SMK-Client-Configuration) controls all aspects of the map.

Creating the configuration by hand is possible, but an easier way to create a simple SMK application is to use the command-line development tool [SMK CLI](). 
This tool lets you initialize a new SMK map application project by answering a few questions.
It also gives you an interactive web-based UI to do more detailed configuration of your map.

If you would like to fork and do your own development on it, take a look at the [developer documentation](docs/development.md).

To see some samples of SMK in action, you can look at the [debug folder](debug).
